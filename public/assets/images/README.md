## AI Instructor Image

Please save the instructor image as `ai-instructor.jpg` in this directory.

The image should show the professional instructor in the classroom setting (the one with Professor Sharma in a gray blazer and white shirt).

### Image Requirements:
- Filename: `ai-instructor.jpg` (or `.png`)
- Recommended size: 800x800px or larger
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Aspect ratio: Square (1:1) works best

### How to Add:
1. Save your instructor image to this folder: `public/assets/images/`
2. Name it: `ai-instructor.jpg`
3. The HomePage will automatically display it

If you use a different filename or format, update line 73 in `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`
